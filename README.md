# Particle Swarm Optimization
4 variations of Particle Swarm Optimization are implemented to find the minima of the following function:
```python
(4.0-2.1*pow(x,2)+pow(x,4)/3.0)*pow(x,2) + x*y + (-4.0 + 4.0*pow(y,2))*pow(y,2)
```

## Output
Each script is going to output the final solution found, a plot for average fitness progress and a plot for best fitness progress.
